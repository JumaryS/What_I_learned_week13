What I learned on week 13.


# The struggle


## Was I really struggling? yes.. yes I was

I was only struggling because I let my personal life excuses prevent me from my study. ( this is a whole different story, boring and not important to the reader )

In the picture above, you can see a code that has two const that have variables called user and new user both are equal to a set of curly braces. The curly brace tells JavaScript that we are creating an object variable. inside the curly brace (our object) we have  keys with a value. keys can only be strings. 


# function within a function or closures
